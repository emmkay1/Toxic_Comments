@0drat I'm not so sure. If brexiters have a common characteristic it's running aile from any responsibility for implementating #Brexit if Labour agree a deal they will share the blame
But the plan of the lexiters may be to replace corbyn with a leftwinger who can't personally be blamed
I mean...maybe this country deserves Brexit &amp; Nigel Farage after all...üòüüòÇ

But my sense is that the Labour leadership are rather like a small village community gleefully watching the hated neighbouring village being  ravaged by an invading army too stupid to see they will be ravaged next. If they facilitate #Brexit they will be destroyed with the tories
One sees this in the leftwing leavers such as @OwenJones84 who are extremely insistent it's all the tories fault yet want brexit to go ahead as much as the tories. What is missing from them is any sense of responsibility to prevent #Brexit wrecking millions of lives
Leftwing leavers believe that #Brexit  will harm millions of people and cause a collapse of capitalism as we know it. They believe that those impoverished by brexit will turn to socialism however for this to work it is essential the tories get all the blame
Equally important as facilitating brexit is ensuring the tories own it and will be blamed. In part this reflects the near universal tendency of brexiters to avoid any responsibility for implementating #Brexit but it also reflects a deeper dillusion on the part of leftwing leavers
Corbyn &amp; Co are perfectly well aware that the way to beat Farage is to offer a full commitment on a 2nd ref but they want #Brexit to happen. This objective is far better served by a Farage win

@DanielleYorks I'm not voting for a Brexit supporting party. Unequivocally no.
@alexyip258 @BorisJohnson @EddieHughes4WN @ExpressandStar No. At this moment in time it‚Äôs more important to vote for who we would like to stand in Parliament for delivering Brexit. Brexit is more important than local issues right now. Brexit is a once in a life time opportunity for us and maybe our only opportunity for the country.

"@gourdonboy 1) The outcome of a vote cannot improve the chances of Brexit being a success, because they're not causally related."
2) Every possible Brexit scenario leaves the UK poorer than staying in.

@gingermarauder @Paul1Singh @yanic1965 @UKLabourIN @EFTA4UK @theSNP Corbyn hoped for a GE and a 'glorious victory'. May hoped to keep her fragile majority intact by appeasing the ERG whilst seeking support from a small number of pro Brexit Labour MPs. Both were doomed to fail but far too many of their MPs would sacrifice the UK to be rid of them!

You will never fool me again"
100% agree with @CarolineLucas here. And I would be very interested to know how many of the people bleating about the betrayal of democracy re: Brexit voted against a more democratic electoral system in the 2011 referendum ü§î https://t.co/LJy2YEPIzh

"@valjamieson @kevthecheff That was the job of the Govt. The Tories have failed.

That's the only 'People's Vote' we need."

@Mr13alls @DavidLammy @theresa_may 9 in the top 100. Brexit has given a lot of overinflated opinions of where the UK stands in the world. Once we have pissed everyone off we'll rapidly deteriorate and wonder why nobody speaks to us any more
I think we can almost all agree that it‚Äôs basically come down to this:
Why do you want Brexit?
Because we voted for it
Why did you vote for it?
Because we want it
And the population is split into people who find this perfectly reasonable &amp; people who find it utterly ridiculous

@EUisOurFuture @NickBoles What distresses me is on a 48/52 split if Brexitiers had gone for a soft Brexit most people would have lived with it. Probably even hard Remainers like me. But pushing for the hardest of Brexits has done so much damage. Not to mention unleashed the forces of racism.
@DPJHodges @inacentre The way to stop all of this was to actually appoint Farage into some sort of position where he had actual responsibility for Brexit. Having a leader and cabinet made up of people who didn‚Äôt believe in their primary task was madness.
"@britainelects @OpiniumResearch It‚Äôs interesting that the majority of ‚Äòremainers‚Äô, so hell bent on stopping a democratic decision, are still intending to vote Labour, a party that is supposedly respecting the vote, and backing brexit.... why is that?"

@Keir_Starmer @Panzerfrank @ParkerCiccone No votes for Labour in my family without a confirmatory ballot on leaving the EU. Nor after Brexit if it happens.
@gavinesler The only Brexit myth is the idea that we could cut a good deal with the EU afterwards. It's largely in the EU's interests to make our trading conditions difficult. Most leavers recognised this and were prepared to leave with No Deal. But MPs threw away our only bargaining chip.

@Andrew_Adonis But @UKLabour supports brexit which has already driven hundreds of thousands of jobs out of theUK. Shame on you. Shame.

@DPJHodges Doesn't this article miss out a huge fact.
This was always inevitable after the 2017 GE - Minority Govt.
Its not that MP's aren't doing their job - they are.
Its that May doesn't have a working majority and neither really did the Brexit result.
