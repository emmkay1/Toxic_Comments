i m not so sure if brexiters have a common characteristic it s running aile from any responsibility for implementating brexit if labour agree a deal they will share the blame
but the plan of the lexiters may be to replace corbyn with a leftwinger who can t personally be blamed
i mean maybe this country deserves brexit nigel farage after all
i m out brexit
who is funding the brexit party
poll majority of brits think brexit referendum was a bad idea brexit
politics isn t just about certain policies which leader you like it s about your ethos your values who you are if you normally vote conservatives then please don t not vote for them because of brexit nothing could be worse for the uk than a corbyn led regime
nothing

may very emotional why oh why are we still pursuing brexit it is so very wrong in all respects we need to stand united more than ever before to lance this disgusting boil which has arisen on our country
i think we can almost all agree that it s basically come down to this
why do you want brexit
because we voted for it
why did you vote for it
because we want it
and the population is split into people who find this perfectly reasonable people who find it utterly ridiculous

a few hundred climate protesters march and the labour party puts forward a commons motion to support them a million remainers march and the labour party ignores them do you get the message a labour vote is a vote for brexit

anyone who argues that we should carry on with brexit regardless of electoral crime which would have invalidated any normal election is quite simply an enemy of democracy whether they know it or not democracy cannot exist when elections are not fair or lawful

if this party was part of the army you would do as your commander told you to with regard to brexit the people is your commander it s about time you did as requested by them and pass the brexit deal no more dallying
watson and i get sick tired of seeing the hypocritical hand wringing of labour corbynites
you are not the only ones
who care
labour is not the only party which cares
corbyn does not deserve remain votes
he must earn them
he respects brexit
nothing left to respect
but my sense is that the labour leadership are rather like a small village community gleefully watching the hated neighbouring village being ravaged by an invading army too stupid to see they will be ravaged next if they facilitate brexit they will be destroyed with the tories
one sees this in the leftwing leavers such as who are extremely insistent it s all the tories fault yet want brexit to go ahead as much as the tories what is missing from them is any sense of responsibility to prevent brexit wrecking millions of lives
leftwing leavers believe that brexit will harm millions of people and cause a collapse of capitalism as we know it they believe that those impoverished by brexit will turn to socialism however for this to work it is essential the tories get all the blame
equally important as facilitating brexit is ensuring the tories own it and will be blamed in part this reflects the near universal tendency of brexiters to avoid any responsibility for implementating brexit but it also reflects a deeper dillusion on the part of leftwing leavers
corbyn co are perfectly well aware that the way to beat farage is to offer a full commitment on a nd ref but they want brexit to happen this objective is far better served by a farage win
people needs to come to the conclusion that is not the solution they will not stop brexit it was never their priority we must stand strong behind and if we do so we will send a very loud message to westminster and all mps
this is part of the new motorway to the hook of holland to allow british brexiteers to leave holland before brexit
it s clear if you want your vote to be counted as supporting ending the brexit debacle for the uk remaining in the eu then voting labour is pointless
in contrast a vote for the is an unequivocal vote to stopbrexit and remain
i will only believe the official count if voters want mep s who are in favour of nhs privatisation and health insurance that is their right i hope that they will be happy with their brexit party choices i won t forgive their selfishness though
you can t do a thing before you win an election and with the attitude of ignoring the elephant in the room aka brexit you will never win an election you d been sleepwalking for years wake up stopbrexit peoplesvote
lovely a whole tread full of sneering remainers you do realise that this just galvanises the leave voters even more and is used by the likes of farage to motivate leave voters further did the remain camp learn nothing about why the brexit vote went the way it did
uk farage he won t cause disruption they see him as a court jester having a lot of brexit clowns in the eu means we have little influence there you are not describing a plan just an event like switching off the tv who wants to be like most of the rest of the world
brexit first foremost allegiances can be sorted later
it won t matter if you re left centre right or any other combination if we don t get rid of eu influence over what we can can t do as sovereign nations
don t fragment now we need everyone

euelections and meps are about fighting farage uk who don t have policies to represent you and the uk while in the eu not about fighting brexit you fight brexit in a generalelectionnow with mps

the number going on about the lds and student loans now is ridiculous
the understanding of brexit as a binary is endemic of a political system that only sees democracy as a fight against the other side rather than on actual democratic process labour and understand this even if it doesnt make the current climate any easier
don t you worry

their policy is very clear try not to say anything commit nothing and try and give both sides of the argument belief that you are on their side then if they ever get power follow thru on brexit to achieve socialist utopia

problem w labour is the message it sends this eu election is not about outcome there is no change of govt or indeed policy that comes out of it it is purely abt optics and the way things stand a vote for labour is a vote for brexit irrespective of how pro eu the candidate is
farage not on this issue if you don t get the advantages of brexit by now it is more likely you have a closed romainer mind
voting for the brexit party is about voting for change no one agrees with everything they say look at the people standing completely different end of politics it s what needs to be done the other two don t represent their voters or the nation
oh i don t agree with everything in it the self flagellation the notion that metropolitan elites are the only people anti brexit and only for selfish reasons as well is i think total balls
just refreshing to read a leaver who isn t dogmatic and has critic thinking skills
farage brexit is dragging on not because it s too difficult in itself but because too many remain supporting mps refuse to abide by our long democratic tradition of accepting the results of elections even when we lose and are wilfully trying to kill brexit
his response to being asked why there was no mention of a confirmatory referendum in labour s euroelex literature was that brexit is a domestic matter
but what has that got to do with anything in regard to backing opposing brexit anyway there s no solid evidence of the illegal campaign having an extremely large effect on the outcome and all in all there are so many other important things to be talking about

brexit eu euco ecb ultimahora bbcqt euro
lexit is best the problem with brexit is it s being done under xenophobic reasoning i prefer remain over the right s brexit but a left wing brexit where we destroy neoliberalism in both the uk and escape it in the eu is ideal
i wonder if the brexit party ukip or some version of the cons run by the erg ever get into power that there will then follow a purge of left wing intellectuals from positions of influence in the country
or alternatively and far more likely that there really are an awful lot of holes to be picked
fact people are trying pick

grant eu what do you mean
the financial settlement uk and eu reached is not a number but that uk upholds the funding commitments made during uk membership and same for eu commitments to uk

not if we all get behind the brexit party at the next election tory voter will realise that s the only way to stop corbyn and leave the eu
leaving the us to life in the u k was one of the best things about the move because with the nhs healthcare worries decreased massively
that the idiots who voted for brexit are willing to throw that away is just depressing

the eu we can acquire rights at a price everything about the brexit process says that price is far higher financially economically reputationally and will have significant impacts to fundamental uk institutions like the privatisation of nhs and allowing in chlorine chicken
it s a fundamental change to the status and our global relationships in the world you can t just lose a bit and carry on not saying it might not be better in the long run but initially it s a huge fracture and that like brexit is never simple
brexit is a restriction of the rights of all british citizens and the opposite of democracy
